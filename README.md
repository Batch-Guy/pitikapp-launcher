# pitikapp-launcher
A simple batch script I made to launch MSI Afterburner, wait 7 seconds, then launch Pitikapp. Nothing fancy.
Just insert your MSI Afterburner and Pitikapp paths in the cd lines, adjust the timing to your liking, and run it! 
I recommend putting this in your startup folder.
That's it, thanks for downloading! Bye!
