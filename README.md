# pitikapp-launcher
A simple batch script I made to launch MSI Afterburner, wait 7 seconds, then launch Pitikapp. Nothing fancy.
Just insert your Afterburner and Pitikapp program paths, then run it. You can adjust the wait time to your liking, I might shorten it down to 4 seconds.
That's all for the README! Thanks for downloading!
